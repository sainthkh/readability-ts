            <p>We already have ourselves a complete implementation of Lox with jlox, so why
                isn’t the book over yet? Part of this is because jlox relies on the <span name="metal">JVM</span>
                to do lots of things for us. If we want to understand
                how an interpreter works all the way down to the metal, we need to build those
                bits and pieces ourselves.</p>
